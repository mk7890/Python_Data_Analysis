# FOOD CARBON FOOTPRINT VISUALIZATION

## Introduction
Climate change is at the center of boardroom discussions, on how the increased talk and regulation will impact businesses and how they can capitalize on this to be sustainable in the future and not treat it as an obstacle to growth. At an individual level we also share in the responsibility of making the right decisions that care for the future generations. The most effective way of doing this is to stay informed on what the major contributors to this 21st century menace is, and thereby make informed choices and shape policy.

In this week's project you will be exploring food carbon emissions- The environmental impacts of our eating habits. Food Carbon Footprint Index 2018 | nu3 Conducted a research on directly comparing different diets in terms of carbon dioxide emissions. The research, which reveals the annual CO2 emissions per person for 130 nations worldwide, shows which countries could significantly reduce their carbon footprint by switching to a plant-based diet, as well as which food types generate the highest carbon dioxide emissions.

# **Insights and the Story Behind My Exploration**

## **The Story Behind Exploring Food Carbon Footprints**
The exploration of food carbon footprints reveals critical insights into the environmental impacts of our dietary choices, focusing on the stark contrast between the carbon emissions of plant-based and animal-based foods. By examining consumption patterns and CO₂ emissions across various food categories and countries, this study sheds light on the environmental challenges associated with food production and highlights opportunities for sustainable practices.

Food production is one of the most significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, and understanding the distribution of these emissions across different food categories provides a deeper insight into how our food choices impact the planet. Through data analysis, I aimed to uncover key trends and patterns that illustrate the disparity in emissions between plant-based and animal-based foods and identify countries where food production contributes disproportionately to global carbon footprints.

## **Key Insights**

### **Disproportionate Emissions from Animal-Based Foods**
The distribution analysis shows that animal-based foods generate significantly higher CO₂ emissions per kilogram per person per year compared to plant-based foods. This disparity arises from several factors:

1. **Resource Intensity** – Feeding, housing, and managing livestock require extensive resources. Crops used as animal feed are cultivated using machinery, fertilizers, and pesticides, all of which emit CO₂. Additionally, these crops are transported to livestock farms, adding another layer of emissions.
2. **Processing and Transportation** – Animal-based food production involves processing, refrigeration, and transportation, which consume large amounts of energy, contributing further to emissions.
3. **Methane Emissions** – Ruminant animals, such as cattle and sheep, produce methane, a greenhouse gas significantly more potent than CO₂.

This highlights the inefficiency of animal-based food production and underscores the need to explore plant-based alternatives for reducing emissions.

### **The Environmental Intensity of Beef Production**
The comparison of mean consumption and CO₂ emissions for beef reveals a striking contrast. While per-person consumption of beef is relatively low, the associated CO₂ emissions are disproportionately high. Key drivers of this disparity include:

1. **High Resource Requirements** – Cattle require significant amounts of feed and water to produce a small amount of meat, making beef production one of the most inefficient food systems.
2. **Deforestation and Habitat Loss** – Large tracts of land are converted for grazing or growing animal feed, leading to deforestation, biodiversity loss, and increased carbon emissions.
3. **Energy Usage** – The processing, refrigeration, and transportation of beef are energy-intensive, further elevating emissions.

This underscores the environmental intensity of beef production and its outsized contribution to global carbon footprints despite its modest consumption levels.

### **Plant-Based Foods Have a Smaller Carbon Footprint**
In contrast to animal-based foods, plant-based foods like rice, wheat, nuts, and soybeans contribute far less to CO₂ emissions, even when their consumption levels are higher. Plant-based food production is more efficient in terms of land, water, and energy usage, making it a more sustainable option. This stark difference highlights the environmental benefits of shifting dietary patterns toward plant-based foods.

### **Geographical Variations in Food-Related Emissions**
Visualization of CO₂ emissions by country emphasizes the dominance of beef in global emissions. Countries with higher per-capita beef consumption, such as Argentina, Brazil, and the USA, show disproportionately high contributions to overall emissions. This reflects the prevalence of livestock farming in these regions and its environmental impact.

In contrast, countries like Kazakhstan and New Zealand exhibit more balanced emissions across multiple food categories. This data underscores the potential for targeted policy interventions in high-emission regions, such as promoting alternative protein sources or reducing beef consumption.

### **Range of Emissions Across Food Categories**
The range of emissions across food categories reveals valuable insights into the variability of carbon footprints:

- **High CO₂ Emission Foods** – Categories like beef, lamb, and dairy exhibit wide variability in emissions. While these foods generally have high environmental footprints, the variation suggests that farming practices significantly influence their emissions.
- **Low CO₂ Emission Foods** – Plant-based foods like rice, wheat, and soybeans show narrower variability, indicating more consistent emissions across production systems.

These observations highlight the importance of adopting best practices in farming to minimize emissions, especially for high-impact foods like beef and dairy.

### **Analysis of the Top 10 Countries by CO₂ Emissions**
Analysis of the Top 10 Countries by CO₂ Emissions provides a global perspective on food-related emissions. Key insights include:

- **Beef consistently ranks as the highest-emission food category in most countries.** For example, Argentina (1712 kg CO₂) and the USA (1118 kg CO₂) are notable contributors, reflecting the environmental cost of cattle farming.
- **Dairy products like milk and cheese contribute significantly to emissions,** particularly in countries like Brazil and Iceland, where dairy farming is prevalent.
- **Regional variations in countries like Kazakhstan** show higher emissions for fish, highlighting the environmental impact of fishing practices in specific regions.
- **Plant-based foods like soybeans, nuts, and rice have minimal emissions across all countries,** reinforcing their role as environmentally sustainable food options.

## **Final Thoughts and Implications**
The analysis reveals that animal-based foods, particularly beef and dairy, are disproportionately responsible for CO₂ emissions, whereas plant-based foods have a far smaller carbon footprint. Shifting toward plant-based foods can significantly reduce global carbon emissions while promoting more efficient resource use.

Regions with high beef and dairy consumption, such as South America and North America, offer significant opportunities for emission reductions through dietary changes and sustainable agricultural practices. The variability in emissions within food categories suggests that adopting best practices, such as regenerative farming or reducing food waste, can mitigate environmental impacts.

Ultimately, understanding the relationship between food consumption and carbon emissions can guide policymakers, businesses, and consumers toward more sustainable food choices. The insights gained from this analysis emphasize the urgency of reducing high-emission foods, promoting plant-based alternatives, and implementing sustainable agricultural practices to combat climate change.
